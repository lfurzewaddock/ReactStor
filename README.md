|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `testBuildBrowser`        | Webpack builds `test` files in to the `dist` directory, suitable for a web browser.  Open `/dist/index.html` in a web browser to see test results in the dev tools console. |
| `testBuildNode`           | Webpack builds `test` files in to the `dist` directory, suitable for Node.  In the termimal run `node_modules/.bin/tape dist/jsdom.environment.js dist/app.bundle.js` to see test results. |
| `testNodeBundle`          | runs testBuildNode, before running tests, piping results to tap-spec CLI terminal reporter. |
| `test`                    | runs ES6+ Tape tests using esm (ES module loader), avoiding Babel, piping results to tap-spec CLI terminal reporter. |
| `testStart`               | Webpack Dev Server compiles `test` files, opening output in default web browser.  See test results in the web browser dev tools console. |
| `testem`                  | TDD UX: runs ES6+ Tape tests using esm (ES module loader), avoiding Babel, with fail/pass tally in the terminal and watches for changes. |
| `debug`                   | runs ES6+ Tape tests with inspector protocol configured to enable process debugging using esm (ES module loader), avoiding Babel. |

| `lintFix`                 | ESLint lint files and attempts to fix issues automatically (write). |
| `coverage`                | sets Node env to dev, NYC instruments code by running ES6+ Tape tests using esm (ES module loader), avoiding Babel. |
